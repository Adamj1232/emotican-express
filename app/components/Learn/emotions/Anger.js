        <h2>What is anger?</h2>
        <p>People often feel angry when they feel like something is not fair or right.</p>
        <p>Anger can be destructive, but sometimes it is necessary and good. Anger can cause people to lash out and be mean to others - it's important for people to think about <strong>why</strong> they are angry. Anger can also help motivate someone to be brave to stand up against something that is wrong, like someone who is angry that a bully is picking on someone and decides to tell the bully to stop.</p>
        <p>Sometimes anger makes people yell. Sometimes it makes people quiet.</p>
        <p>If someone near you is angry and you feel unsafe, tell a grown up that you trust.</p>
        <p>When was the last time you felt angry? Why did you feel angry?</p>
