        <h2>What is happiness?</h2>
        <p>People feel happy when they have a sense of wellbeing: their needs are being met, they feel comfortable being themselves, and they enjoy what they are doing.</p>
        <p>Maybe they are spending time with friends and loved ones. Maybe they are baking, or drawing, or fixing something, or another activity they enjoy. Maybe they feel content and safe.</p>
        <p>Feelings of happiness can be expressed many different ways. People smile when they are happy. Sometimes they laugh and hug, sometimes they are quiet and still. Sometimes people can be so happy that they even cry!</p>
        <p>When was the last time you felt happy? What did you do when you felt happy?</p>
